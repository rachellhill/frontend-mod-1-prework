## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The part taking care of your brain resonated with me the most. It's important to prioritize staying healthy and taking care my yourself as I start this new journey where my brain will constantly be stimulated with new information. I feel as though I already view learning as a process and it's why I decided to apply to Turing in the first place. I am motivated by learning more and know that it will continue to motivate me at Turing and my future role as a software engineer. I would like to foster more of a growth mindset as I currently am deterred by lack of confidence which is something I try to work on daily. I think this list offers the perfect starting guide to work on becoming a super learner, which I will try and practice in my daily life not only at Turing but personally as well.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The data types I learned about in this section were Number, String and Boolean. The number data types are pretty self explanatory where any number can be identified as a data type including negative numbers and decimals to perform math operations in JS. String data types remind me of sentences within JavaScript but any text can be entered in a string, always wrapped in quotes". Last, Boolean data types have only two values, true or false and are useful when telling a computer what a computer should return.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
To indicate comments, use two back slashes or //. This tells the computer not to interpret any text written after //
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
telling the computer to remember this value, which is the variable you are defining.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
When entering a 21+ website, day, month and year are most likely the variables which a user enters and javascript runs a boolean which tells the site if the birthday is greater than 21 years of age, they will receive access to the site. If not, they will be redirected elsewhere.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatention means to join two or more variables together to create a string / sentence.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
When logging into your email inbox where it said, "Hello, Rachel, you have 123132 unread emails" is concatenating my name as a variable, as well as how many unread emails I received since I last checked.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I am confused how all the work I am doing is saving and nervous I am doing it wrong, but I think I just need to keep progressing and gathering feedback. Atom is a little confusing to me but I believe it's for editing files? More clarification on when / where to use atom would be helpful!
