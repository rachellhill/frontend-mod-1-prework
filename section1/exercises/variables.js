In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result.

A couple examples that are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

When navigated to the root of this project directory, you should be able to run this

*/


// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var sentence = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!';
console.log(sentence);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = 'Rachel';
console.log(firstName);
var isHungry = true;
console.log(isHungry);

var numberOfPets = 1;
console.log(numberOfPets);


// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
// I chose my name as the firstName data type. For the isHungry variable,
// I chose firstName in case I needed to use it in a sentece to show that I am hungry.
// For the last data type, I assigned 1 as the variable because I own 1 dog.

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
firstName = "Tara";
console.log(firstName);
isHungry = "Tara";
console.log(isHungry);
numberOfPets = 3;
console.log(numberOfPets);


// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
var totalSnacks = healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks;
console.log(totalSnacks);

// FINAL CHECK

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
// yes!
