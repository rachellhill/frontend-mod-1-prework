## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- The SMART Goals point resonated with me the most because keeping these strategies in the back of my head as I start Mod 1 and am given lengthy projects that I may not know where to even start will help me break down the problem a bit better and approach it with more confidence. The second is striving to improve within one's Zone of Proximal Development stuck with me because I know that I do not know the answer to every problem or all languages in code. I can control what I've learned and can also control learning more when it comes to facing problems and what I need to do to fix them. This is where stepping out of my comfort zone comes into play, but also where I will learn the most and probably gain great experience doing so, which will always be the motivating factor behind problem solving.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I am a very process driven worker already where I focus a lot of what worked and what didn't, and how I can improve an issue. Taking a step back to reevaluate a problem when I am stuck or need to fix something is often inevitable and a massive part of problem solving. I think my confidence levels deter me from having a growth mindset at times because of that little voice inside my head sometimes tells me I can't do it, when I know that if I take the time and effort I will produce something useful and usually am proud of the outcome. Finding a way to always have confidence in myself I think will allow my growth mindset to take off. ðŸš€
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- I believe Twitter is an example of arrays where it shows a list of strings, which is what you have tweeted recently.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- Array methods are built in functions in Javascript that can be applied to arrays, which alters the arrays based on the many different methods that can be applied.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is really to save a lot of manual work when needing to repeat a condition across multiple values. We use loops in conjunction with an array when there is a specific set of values that need to be checked by a certain condition, where as without an array we just would loop something n amount of times.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is checking if a statement is true or false repeatedly.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I think more clarification on the 3rd to last question about when to use loops with arrays and when not to would be great! Feedback would be appreciated!
