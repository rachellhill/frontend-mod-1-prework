//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.pop();
//console.log(animals.pop()); <-- should not use array methods in console log as it is an informative command
var count = animals.push('Gorilla');
console.log(count);
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = 'Tiger';
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals.unshift('Elephant');
//console.log(animals.unshift("Elephant")); <-- should not use array methods in console log as it is an informative command
console.log(animals);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Salad', 'Bread'];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push('Broccoli');
//console.log(foods.push("Broccoli"));
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
//console.log(foods.pop());
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift('Cereal', 'Oatmeal', 'Waffles');
//console.log(foods.unshift('Cereal', 'Oatmeal', 'Waffles'));
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
//console.log(foods.shift());
console.log(foods);


//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Pinterest is an app that I commonly use which I believe is similar to Instagram where it shows lists of pictures
// that I might like or pin to my board, which is a list of pictures that I like.
// 2: I think Twitter is similar as it shows my tweets, which could essentially be an array of strings that as I tweet more and more, I'm adding more to the array.
// 3: Slack uses arrays when giving users the capability of creating a channel or a slack group. The people in the group are an array of who is in that specific group.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "home";

// Write your conditional here
// The line below is a conditional statement where it's saying "if the user has a charger and that charger type is a car charger, the user can call an uber".
if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  console.log("Your Uber is on its way!");
  // if the above coniditions meet this if statement, "your uber is on its way" will be returned.
  // if the above code returns false, then the below statement runs. It's asking if the user does not have a car charger and the batter percentage is less than 15,
  // the user will not be able to call an uber and the message "you are unable to call an uber" is returned.
} else if (hasCharger === false && chargerType != "car" && percentBatteryLeft < 15) {
  console.log("You are unable to call an Uber");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
