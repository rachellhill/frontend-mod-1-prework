## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- I like following the pomodoro method because it eases my mind a bit more knowing that it's good to take breaks and can lead to more productivity setting these pom breaks to finish tasks.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I will say it could have gone better. These last couple days have been jam packed with work, studying, and finalizing prework, which is a lot of tasks to complete. I wrote out a list of tasks and used the pom technique to see how far I can get. I wanted to at least get through most of my prework, which I did accomplish so that's great.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a data structure in programming that allows us to store more complex data. An object is different from an array in Javascript where an array stores an ordered list of data that's elements can only be accessed by calling index position or numbers. However, with objects we're able to access the data stored within the curly braces using strings.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - An array would be best for this because first it is a list of names, or strings, that you can access by calling an index of an element, which would be a student's name.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - This would be stored in an object as the capitals are characteristics that define a state and you can add more information to further identify a state.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - This would be better to store this list in an array as it's a simple packing list storing single values for a packing list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - this would be an array as it is a list of names who you follow on instagram and you can access their index in terms of who was your earliest / latest followers.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - This would be an object, because
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - This would be stored in an object because there are ingredients and measurements, which is similar to key-value pairs to store the information in how to bake a cake.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - I think this could go either way. An array would work if you just wanted to provide a list of your favorite restaurants. An object would come into play if you'd like to provide more details or characteristics to describe your favorite restaurants, such as location, cuisine, price, etc.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Amazon stores a ton of data when it comes to purchases made on the app with similar keys as the transaction item object. For example, it could have keys like price, orderDate, primeCustomer, confirmation, etc. Their ability to track their customer's use and purchases through Amazon helps cater their product more for the user. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- What's the difference between methods as a function that are stored inside a key value pair and behavior methods?
- is there a resource for the functions / behavior methods that we can use to to understand what we can use in objects to manipulate the data? I had a hard time completing the last exercises (classMethods,js and tweet.js) because of the use of array methods as well as some syntax from loop iterations.
- I also had a hard time completing the array vs. object exercise because I know they could go either way but the use of either objects or arrays would be dependent on how you'd like to manipulate the data.
