//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
// this should log: true
console.log(numberTeachers == stringTeachers);

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
// this should log: false
console.log(numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log(numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log(numberStudents >= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log(numberStudents >= 21);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log(numberStudents <= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log(numberStudents <= 21);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
// Comparing two number types asking if 4 is less than 9
// this should log: true
var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// Declare a variable books assign to number 3. Return the boolean answer when asked if 4 is less than 3.
// this should output: false
var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// Declare a variable named friends assigned to 6 and declare a siblings variable assigned to 2. Return boolean output if friends is greater than siblings.
// this should return: true
var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// Declare a variables named attendees and assign to 9. Declare a second variable named meals and assign to 8
// asking if attendees does not equal meals
// this should output: true

//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
var isPuppy = (age <= 1);
console.log(lovesToPlay && isPuppy);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER:
// My final line of code evaluated to true because I defined a new variable where a dog is a puppy if their age is less than or equal to 1
// Then I logged the logical operator && to determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy.

//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
// yes, there was a typo in lines 88-100 that was console.logs() but I fixed it on my end and cannot remember which had the typo.
