## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I feel like I am at a happy medium when asking questions and might lean a little more towards the too soon side. Especially with learning something entirely new to me like coding, I sometimes can feel panicked or worried I am doing everything wrong so reach out for that validation right away. However, I also do not want to ask a silly dumb question so I do take the time to figure out how to best ask this question or work to solve it before I ask.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I liked that it forced me to find the answer and actually try to remember it for future reference as I continue on each section but sometimes it wasn't easy as navigating to find the right answer is not always exactly what you need or looking for. It was uncomfortable to start out, but after taking the time to learn where I could find the information and use that to guide me felt better. It supports my learning by forcing me to go outside of my comfort zone to find the answers on my own.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is when we need the computer to perform different actions based on different conditions. I think a conditional that I use on a daily basis is logging into Salesforce or my email. The condition would ask if my username and password are true, which would grant me access to the website. If I entered that information incorrectly, then I would not be granted access to login and given an error message.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you would use the if, else, else if to create more complex statements which execute their blocks of code when the previous conditions equals false. Once a block of code equals true, that tells the program to execute that line of code and stop after that.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
You would use logical operators to check if two conditions are met and determine a result from running those. Then, you can add more logical operators depending what you are trying to ask in order to achieve a more complex statement.
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I don't have any questions other than feedback on my if-statements.js exercise. I know there's multiple ways I could have written that but would love to receive feedback!
